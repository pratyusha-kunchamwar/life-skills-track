## General MVC

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a popular architectural pattern used to organize code in a structured manner.

It divides the application into three interconnected components:
  - Model
  - View 
  - Controller

  ### **Model** 
 - Manages and stores data.
 - Interacts with databases or backend services.
 - Handles business logic and data validation.
 ### **View** 
 - Displays data to the user.
 - Updates based on changes in the Model or Controller.
 - Focuses on presenting data without modifying it.
 ### **Controller** 
 - Manages and stores data.
 - Interacts with databases or backend services.
 - Handles business logic and data validation.
### **Example**
In a restaurant, the Chef is the Model. Itâ€™s job is to take orders (requests) from the Waiter and create some awesome food for the Waiter to deliver to the Customer.

- **Client** :User
- **Controller** :Waiter
- **Model** : Chef 
- **View** : Table
